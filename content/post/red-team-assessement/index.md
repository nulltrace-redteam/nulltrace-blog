## What is Red Team Assessment?

A red team assessment is a goal-based hostile activity that necessitates an adversary's big-picture, holistic vision of the organization. This evaluation is tailored to the demands of complex companies that handle a wide range of sensitive assets using technological, physical, or process-based methods.

The aim of a red teaming assessment is to show how real-world attackers may combine apparently unrelated flaws to accomplish their objectives. It's a good method to demonstrate that even the most advanced firewall in the world is useless if an attacker can walk out of the data center with an unencrypted hard disk. Rather of depending on a single network appliance to protect sensitive data, employ a defense-in-depth strategy and continually enhance your people, processes, and technology.

How can Red Teaming assist my company?
Given today's cyberthreat environment, it's critical for businesses to have the right protocols, policies, and processes in place to keep their data safe, infrastructure strong, and, ultimately, to make them resilient. In 2017, the 2013 Yahoo data breach was estimated to have compromised almost 3 billion accounts, while the Equifax data breach surpassed the greatest publicly revealed thefts ever recorded, with 145.5 million customers affected. These hacks, as well as the WannaCry and Petya intrusions, are foreshadowing of what is to come in the cyber world. With this in mind, businesses must test their systems and networks to determine their vulnerability to a successful attack before an attacker does.

## Red Teaming Steps:

1) Planning
The first element of a red team evaluation generally includes planning and establishing assessment goals. The red team evaluation may be tailored to the needs of the company being analyzed. The red team, for example, could merely be needed to show the capacity to access sensitive data rather than exfiltrate it. Allowing the use of social engineering as part of the evaluation is a typical constraint.
Assuring that all parties engaged in the red team assessment are on the same page about the assessment's guidelines is a critical aspect of this step.
The team may begin organizing their approach after the assessment's ground rules have been established. Certain lines of approach may be more or less promising for the evaluation depending on the circumstances of the examination. Making a basic strategy for the evaluation ahead of time reduces the likelihood of wasted effort and unwanted outcomes, as well as making role assignments easier within the team.

2) Reconnaissance
A crucial component of a red team operation is gathering information about IT infrastructure, facilities, and employees. Open-Source Intelligence Gathering may provide a lot about a target's personnel, facilities, reaction capabilities, and technological composition, including physical and logical security controls, foot traffic, topography, infiltration and exfiltration locations, and so on. It starts to construct a picture of the target and its major functions, as well as the dangers that exist, via extensive investigation.

3) Target Identification
The red team should have a lot of knowledge about the target's digital and physical routines and Defenses by the time the reconnaissance phase is completed. The red team sifts through this information during the target identification stage of the attack to find possible weaknesses and strategies to accomplish their goals. Active data collection methods such as network scanning and enumeration are also used in this phase. In order to increase the chances of their attack being successful, the team would usually attempt to discover multiple distinct attack pathways.

4) Gaining Access
The red team takes their first substantial aggressive actions against the organization at this stage of the review. To reduce the possibilities of discovery, activities conducted during the reconnaissance phase are designed to be passive or have a low effect.
The red team uses the weaknesses discovered in the previous stages to circumvent or defeat the organization's defenses in the Gaining Access Phase. This might involve exploiting software flaws, utilizing social engineering to manipulate staff, or circumventing physical barriers. The phase's final aim is to provide the red team a footing within the target's defenses that may be extended to meet the assessment's goals.

5) Maintaining Access
Once a red team has gained access to a system, one of their main objectives is to maintain that access. It may be difficult or impossible to retain access to the system using the initial connection, depending on the attack vector used to acquire access. The red team extends and strengthens their footing on the target network during this phase of the assessment, building communications channels and persistence mechanisms to ensure that they have a sufficient degree and duration of access to meet the assessment's goals.

6) Reporting
Reporting is an important part of the Red Team Engagement process. Reports are a common kind of evidence that may be evaluated and utilized to build a foundation for better security. Reports are crucial because they attest to the presence of interaction. Reports not only capture the activities that took place during a single engagement, but they also serve as a valuable resource for planning and designing future interactions. Many interactions have similar aims and techniques.
Reports may be used to plan and develop future encounters. The Red Team is motivated by objectives that aim to stimulate or measure not just technological weaknesses, but also overall security activities. People, procedures, and technology are all part of this. It is the red team's job to record the vulnerabilities uncovered during their evaluation in a clear and thorough manner, including how they may be confirmed and exploited for future testing.
